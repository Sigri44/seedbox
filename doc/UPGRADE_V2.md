# Upgrade to V2

**Seedbox version 2 is here!** üî•

Since there are some breaking changes and a configuration structure migration, a major version was mandatory.

## What's new?

* **Configuration change to new YAML format**
  * Run ``cd tools/config-updater && ./config-updater.sh`` to migrate your old services.conf to the new config.yaml format.
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è ``jq`` (v1.5+) and ``yq`` (v4+) are now requirements
  * Easier feature switches
  * If a service is missing, it won't be enabled by default like before. The config is now more declarative.
  * Traefik routing rules are now dynamically generated in a file in Traefik config directory, so no more Docker labels. They became hard to maintain due to all possibilities caused by VPN support or custom files for example.
  * New config syntax documented in the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md#configuration-structure-and-parameters).
* **VPN support**
  * With ``gluetun`` service, you can now place any service behind a VPN.
  * Default gluetun configuration is Wireguard "custom" mode, but see below...
  * More details in the [VPN section of the Configuration Guide](./configuration.md#vpn).
* **Support custom services and docker-compose yaml files**
  * Place a docker-compose yaml file in ``services/custom/`` directory, add a service in your config.yaml specifying a ``customFile``, and you are set.
  * Support Plex hardware transcoding using a custom-file, already available in the ``services`` directory (just specify a ``customFile`` on plex service - see [config.sample.yaml](../config.sample.yaml)).
  * More details in the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md#add-your-own-service).
* **Support arbitrary Traefik rules**
  * Place a Traefik YAML in ``samples/custom-traefik/`` directory, it will be copied in the Traefik configuration folder.
  * Ideal to forward traffic to other services which do not belong to this seedbox.
  * More details in [this section of the Configuration Guide](./configuration.md#integration-with-other-services-custom-traefik-config)
* **Disable certificates for some domains**
  * Using the flag ``httpOnly: true`` on a service, access any service in unsecure mode, delegating certificates management on a higher level (reverse proxy, firewall...). More details in the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md#disable-https-completely).
* **Multiple hosts for any services**
  * The new config structure allows for more customization, for example you can now have many routes on the same service. Let's say, a local unsecured route + a secured one for remote access. Or anything you want.
* **More customization**
  * Such as http authentication which is no more hardcoded but configurable for each service.
  * Configurable paths on host for persistent data
* **New services**
  * ``Gluetun``: [VPN client (see above)](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun)
  * ``Heimdall``: [Dashboard](https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall)
  * ``Readarr``: [Ebook and comic monitor](https://github.com/Readarr/Readarr)
  * ``Komga``: [Comic Book Manager](https://github.com/gotson/komga)
  * ``Kavita``: [Comic / Book Manager](https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita)
  * ``Syncthing``: [P2P files synchronization](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-syncthing)
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker compose v2.2+ is now required

And also:

* ``update-all.sh`` is now called ``run-seedbox.sh`` but its purpose is the same.
* More checks in ``run-seedbox.sh``. For example, throws an error if Flood is enabled but not Deluge, or if VPN is enabled on a service but the VPN client is not.
* You can now specify where your data lives on your host through new environments variables (see [.env.sample](.env.sample)).
  * This change is backward-compatible as the ``run-seedbox.sh`` script will default to the old "/data/torrents" and "/data/config" paths if these variables are not set.
* ``networks:`` section is now aligned with the new docker compose syntax
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Nextcloud-db has moved. It is now in ``/data/config`` (or somewhere else if you set the new variables for host paths) (see below how to mitigate the errors). [See the dedicated section below](#nextcloud-db-has-moved).
* Disable Traefik access logs
* New flag ``--debug`` for ``run-seedbox.sh`` to see what is happening during configuration parsing.
* Releases are named after LOST mythology. I exhausted all the characters of Person of Interest, so that's time for a change. Only geeks will get it, I know.

## Some reading about configuration

üìñ Do not forget to read the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md).

## How to migrate

```sh
cd tools/config-updater
./config-updater.sh
# Check the content of your .env file (in comparison with .env.sample which brings new variables)
# Also, check your generated config.yaml and read the config documentation (in doc/configuration.md)
cd ../..
./run-seedbox.sh
```

When everything runs smoothly, you can delete your old configuration file which is now useless:

```sh
rm -f services.conf
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Also, please make sure you have read the next section about Nextcloud Database location.

## Nextcloud-db has moved

Since commit e4ede925a8ce09b177206f30487a889da9e10334, nextcloud-db directory (mapped on /var/lib/mysql) has moved from
``/data/nextcloud-db`` to ``$HOST_CONFIG_PATH/nextcloud-db`` (*/data/config/nextcloud-db by default*).

To ensure a smooth transition, you will have to move the directory nextcloud-db into the correct new location, then run some commands to fix the schema:

```sh
mv /data/nextcloud-db/ /data/config/
./run-seedbox.sh
source .env
docker exec -it nextcloud-db mysql_upgrade -u root -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
docker restart nextcloud nextcloud-db
```

Ensure everything runs nicely by looking at nextcloud-db and nextcloud logs, and by accessing your Nextcloud web UI.
